 Notes for reviewer:
 1.) You can test the 500 error handling by visting the /test-error route

Changes to supplied styles and formats:
1.) Changed button text on Submit and Update book forms to "Submit." This way I can re-use the form.
2.) Changed "create new book" link to "Add Book" button. I think it looks more professional.
3.) Added url query support to all-books view so adding and deleting books can show success message to the user about actions that have been performed.
4.) I commented out the .4s transition effects in style.css. I prefer the browsing experience better without them.
